# Interactive Brain Model Quiz
## How-to-Use
This is a quiz on the brain lobes and their basic functions. Hovering over each region will highlight it in a random color, and clicking on a region will prompt a quiz question.
## Resources
I relied heavily on the Three.js manual and documentation throughout this project, making it a significant learning experience. I also referenced several YouTube videos for additional guidance.
